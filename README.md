# Detrimental-Emotion-Detection-Using-Facial-features-for-Mentally-ill-Patients
This project uses Python to classify a person's emotional features using a CNN model to determine their levels of anxiety, depression, and stress (ADS). The monitoring device will emit a sound alert when an ADS level threshold is reached, and the patient's caretaker will also receive an SMS alert on their mobile phones. This project is primarily intended for patients who require ongoing observation but whose caregivers are unable to do so effectively.
